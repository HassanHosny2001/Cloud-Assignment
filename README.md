# Cloud-Assignment
I have two books and I make a copy of them in two separate text file ,then I read them with "open" function on python and I take a consider of these issues:
1. Make files' words lower case,
2. Remove all punctuation marks,
3. The encoding of the files, e.g. utf-8.
After all of that I made an intersection between these two files to get common words between of them and I get 878 common words.
Then I build an image on docker desktop and run it on the container.
